## Beacon Hill - pricy

Beacon Hill is one of Boston’s original neighborhoods, and prospective homeowners can expect historic real estate dating back to the city’s colonial roots. For example, buyers can visit Acorn Street, where historic Federal-style row houses on cobblestone streets are adorned with laid-brick sidewalks glow under antique gas lamps.
