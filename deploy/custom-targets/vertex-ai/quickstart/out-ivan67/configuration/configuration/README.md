Ciao Riccardo,
this is just to remind you that this dir gets copied in its entirety (with some hydration)

* FROM: deploy/custom-targets/vertex-ai/quickstart/configuration/ (TEMPLATES)
* TO: deploy/custom-targets/vertex-ai/quickstart/out/configuration/ (HYDRATED version)

Change happens when you invoke this script: `06-create-cd-stuff.sh`

This also means: **edit the latter at your own risk**.

## CHANGELOG

Let me also add a history for you :)

* 11mar24: v1.1 Added dev/ folder too to comply with Ivan requirements.
* 22feb24: v1.0 First copy of original from GH.
