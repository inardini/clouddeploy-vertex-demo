Ciao Riccardo,
this is just to remind you that this dir gets copied in its entirety (with some hydration)

* FROM: deploy/custom-targets/vertex-ai/quickstart/configuration/ (TEMPLATES)
* TO: deploy/custom-targets/vertex-ai/quickstart/out/configuration/ (HYDRATED version)

This means: edit the latter at your own risk.

Let me also add


## VERSION HISTORY

* 11mar24: Added dev/ folder too to comply with Ivan requirements.
